# Area-under-any-distribution
This Python script can integrate the area of any Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------

1. This script will make slices, find area of each slice and then add. 

2. In our case its calculating the B.dl for a desired length.
   
3. In new set of data, make sure that, your first colum title is Z,
                                      and second column title is B

4. double clicking will not work, as it requires few packages. 
   Best approach would be download pycharm or Jupiter IDE

5. The updated script is Area_3.py. If there is positive or 
   negative vallay, it will make vector sum and show net result.
